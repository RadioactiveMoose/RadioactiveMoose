Hello dear reader,

This work is still ongoing, thus here are some bullet points :

## Can I use this solver for my research ?

Please do, as long as I am credited. 
Crediting me allows me easier request for developping the solver and generally asking for help !
Moreover, do not hesitate to feedback on the solver, whether it's a thank or bug report ;) 

## Which version of OpenFOAM ?

The OpenFOAM version used for this solver is OpenFOAM 12 (Foundation), porting to OpenFOAM 13 will happen soon (October-November 2025). 
Normally it is a "copy-paste" task but having not watched closely yet I will not warranty that it is.

## What boiling models are availables now ?

Right now only the Lee boiling model is featured and it is not benchmarked. 
When done, I will publish a table of the tested fluids and associated parameters. 

## Will other boiling model be available ?

Following the structure of fvModels/VoFCavitation, it is possible to add more boiling models. 
I intend to do so in the next months with the Schrage models and other relatively simple models.
RPI might come but is not a priority as for now. 

## Other addition planned to the solver ?

I intend to also implement the Shear Lift Force as fvModels before beginning 2026.
